# CSGO Reportbot
This nodejs reportbot has been rewritten from the ground up to support live on-going matches.

# What you will need
- NodeJS 
- 10 Steam accounts with CS:GO (they'll get 11 reports if you also report in game)
- You can buy cheap csgo accounts via CD keys etc for about $6-7 each

# Limitations
- You can only report one account every 6 hours (Steam API limitation)

# What I will cover here
- I will not cover installing nodejs, you can find thousands of tutorials online. Personally I have an AWS account with a Free tier EC2 instance that I connect via ssh and do my reporting from there.
